# Hannibal
Hannibal is an adaptive engine for 3D Web digital heritage artefacts in Web-Based Virtual Museums (WBVMs). It uses a forward chaining expert system hooked to a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> Database Management System (DBMS). Hannibal is a middleware that works with [Omeka](https://omeka.org/ "Omeka DAMS") Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) as a backend and with a <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">leaflet JS</a> map-based Web-Based Virtual Museum on the front end. 

Hannibal is presented in repository in a way that allows you to use it in your virtual museum. You can also alter it to be used in any adaptive application that requires doing an action based on a set of decisions.
